  - Corrected invalid Tailwind import statement
  - Changed `@import "tailwindcss/preflight` to `@tailwind base`
- Simplified theme implementation to avoid build errors
  - Removed complex ThemeProvider component

## Environment Setup Required
For the contact form to work, you need to create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:
```
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
CONTACT_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
```

## Next Steps
